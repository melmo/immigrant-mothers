1,stuff,from,giving,family,pl,female,"Here everything is much cheaper so you can afford buying clothes for your child. … I collect everything and send it over to my sister. She has a 6-year-old son and now also a 1-year-old daughter. I ship everything to Poland. I collect it, put it aside, and then send it over. A big, 30 kg parcel costs 15 pounds."
2,stuff,from,presenting,family,pl,female,"I think that right now, things are the same, here and there. So it sort of makes little sense to buy things here and send them over to Poland, as one did in the old days. But I have a feeling that for Polish kids the things sent from over here seem more attractive, a bit better — so that sort of mentality still persists, that maybe here things are better quality. … Even if I order something via Allegro [a Polish eBay-like service] for my nephew, in Poland, I always tell my sister to tell him that auntie sent it over from England. I think that’s more attractive for him.  … Always when I go to Poland, I bring presents for the kids. … I realize that [my sister’s] daughter has mostly hand-me-downs so I buy clothes for her. "
3,baby clothes,to,presenting,family,us,female,"In Poland, I couldn’t afford buying baby clothes in a store. But back then I was still with my ex and my mother-in-law would send me many clothes over from the US. And here — that’s not a problem at all because, you know, everything is cheaper here and you can afford to go and buy clothes for your child. "
