1,baby clothes,from,keeping and bringing,,,,"I still have many things after my older son. I kept everything. For the older one, I bought everything myself – I simply bought it in stores: at H&M, sometimes at Next. Next is nice, but more expensive. Now I also try to buy in supermarkets: when we go shopping, I like to have a look at the clothes department. ",,
2,baby clothes,to,buying and selling,friend,uk,female,"For the younger one I also received some clothes from a friend here because he was born in a different season of the year than his older brother: when Jake was wearing the size up to 6 months, it was all summer stuff and with the younger one I needed winter baby clothes. I talked to this friend, whose son is 1 now and I said: oh, these clothes are so sweet. She asked: you want? So I said: why not? I gave her 20 pounds because I thought: the clothes are so nice and there are so many of them, I just can’t take them for free. ",,

4,baby clothes,from,giving,family member,pl,female,"One of the girls from the church asked if I could sell her some baby clothes, but my sister is trying to get pregnant so I already promised her I would keep them for her. So for now I keep everything. I can’t wait for her to get pregnant so that I can get rid of everything. Even though I don’t have that many yet: just for the newborn, 3-6 months. ",1,
5,toys,to,presenting,family members,uk,female/male,"We still have lots of toys that were Jake’s. And we bought some too. And as we have family here, grandparents, they also buy stuff. Or they used to, for Jake. Now I ask them not to buy anything anymore because we already have so much that there is no room to store it all. ",,
6,childrens items,from,presenting,family member,pl,female,"When I didn’t have children, I would always bring something for the kids. Now that every penny counts… it’s enough for them that we visit them. I mean, I always buy something for them – something small, some sweets. Now my sister asked me to buy shoes for her daughter so I did and I said: don’t give me back the money because [your daughter] just had her birthday so it is going to be a present for her. Now in Poland one can buy so many nice things that it makes no sense to bring things over. ",,
