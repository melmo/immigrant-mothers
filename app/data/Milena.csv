1,baby clothes,from,giving,family member,pl,female,One of my cousins in Poland has two daughters who are older than Ania and now they became foster parents to a girl who is younger than Ania so the clothes that are too small for Ania — we take them to Poland when we go [three times a year]. And sometimes we also get some clothes when we’re there. Children grow out of things so quickly. ,,"Clothes in Poland are very expensive when compared to the earnings. I buy very few things in Poland. Here there's - it's not even that there's more choice, not that. But when things are on sale - they're properly on sale: 70%, not 20% like in Poland. So I don't really buy things in Poland. I must really like something, it must be something special."
