1,baby clothes,to,giving,family members,pl,female/male,"In Poland, we have a neighbor, a little girl, and she’s older than Jurek and so when mom sends us a parcel, she puts in some of the girl’s clothes. They’re pink so he doesn’t wear them outdoors, he sleeps in them. So the stuff he wears at home, the stuff he sleeps in – that’s second hand; and the stuff he wears outdoors – I buy it new. ",,
1,stuff,to,presenting,family members,pl,female/male,"Every 3-4 months my mom orders some meat in the countryside and sends it over so that the little one eats healthily, ecologically. I don’t buy any meat here. I don’t know, I’m just not convinced. They send [the meat] over frozen. So here [in the living room] I have one freezer, another one in the kitchen, and this is how I store it all. So the little one is used to this type of food. He doesn't like English sausages. He also doesn’t like English food at school. So I don’t know if it’s just my attitude, but at least I know what I give to my child. … My parents don’t ever want anything. I transfer money to an account in Poland and my mom can withdraw it any time. This is how we try to help them. But of course, she won’t hear about it. So the parcels they send is a sort of help – since they cannot help us out financially, they want to help us like this, by sending little presents to their grandson.",,
