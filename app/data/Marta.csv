1,baby clothes,to,giving,family member,pl,female,Some clothes I got from my sister [who has two sons] – not much because I always told everyone I didn’t want to have children for a very long time so she wasn’t keeping anything for me. She brought some of the clothes with her when she came to visit me towards the end of my pregnancy – cause we already knew it would be a boy. And some stuff I brought over from Poland myself when I went to visit when Alex was three months old.

2,baby clothes,to,buying and selling,colleague,uk,female,"Now I mostly buy clothes, but when Alex was small we got some things from people. One of my colleagues sold me some baby clothes, from her daughter – her daughter was very young and had a baby boy – so a big bag of very, very nice clothes for 20 pounds, I think, cause she wanted to get rid of them and those were all things that had hardly been worn, hardly used. "
3,stuff,to,borrowing and lending,friend,uk,female,"Another colleague – who has since become a friend – also gave me some bags filled with baby clothes. …  I also had a bathtub and a little cradle from her, but it was all borrowed. She said: make sure to give them back to me, don’t give them away. "
4,stuff,from,giving,colleague,uk,female,"Until a couple of months ago I had been collecting everything, waiting for an occasion to pass it all on to someone, and finally my other good colleague had a baby so I gave lots of stuff to her. Though I still have some things I need to get rid of. "
5,cradle,to,presenting,family member,pl,male,"Dad asked what we wanted to have and here, in England, cots and cradles are way more expensive than in Poland. Only at Ikea you can buy something below 100 pounds, but generally they go for 300 pounds and in Poland you can get one for 300-400 zl, even including the courier, it pays off. "
