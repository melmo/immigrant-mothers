1,stuff,to,presenting,family member,pl,female,"When my mom, so grandma, wants to give them a present, she buys it in Poland and then we need to arrange the transport. She sends it via a courier. Sending it via post is very expensive: a 2 kg package costs as much as 30kg via a courier. ",,"Here you buy original clothes for kids, I odn't know, like Adidas, or some original jackets and it's not an expense that hits your budget much. In Poland, I remember when Monika was small and I wanted to buy her sandals, I went to a store and saw that Adidas goes for 100 zl, I decided, hmm, it's a bit too much for a child. And here one goes, spends the 20 pounds, and it's not a big sum, one can afford it."
2,childrens items,from,keeping and bringing,,pl,,"When we go to Poland on vacation, instead of taking a suitcase, I send some children’s stuff via a courier: clothes and such. So that I don’t have to drag the suitcase to the airport, then drag the children and the suitcase, a call a courier service. It costs more or less the same and it’s easier. ",,
3,stuff,from,giving,family member,uk,female,"Maja, in London, was pregnant after me so she could make use of some of the things. A baby car seat, for example. The stroller we threw away because the wheel was acting funny, it wasn’t in a good that would allow us to sell it. But other things — the car seat, and a special chair for babies. Some things that I had for my son, I never used. A baby walker, for example. ",,
4,stroller,to,buying and selling,commercial ebay,,,"Generally, I think that spending 400, 500 pounds on a new stroller — that’s 2500 zl — that’s an exaggeration. So I bought such things on eBay, in a very good condition — here one can buy good things for a good price. ",,
