1,baby clothes,to,buying and selling,commercial ebay,,,"I used to buy kids’ clothes in second-hand stores. Now I rather rely on eBay or [regular] stores. What’s awful here is that kids, at least my kids, don’t change after school from their uniforms, so they wear black pants, white shirts, and green sweaters, non stop. I can’t take it. On Fridays, I tell them to change so that I don’t have to look at it anymore. So, actually, they don’t need that many clothes at all. We can always find something in a second-hand, but I prefer some insane deals on eBay. It’s very easy to find a good deal here, many people sell stuff. Most of our shoes are from eBay. "

We don’t buy things when we need them, but, for example, now Children’s Day is coming so we buy stuff much earlier and store it somewhere and hope they won’t find it. We buy everything earlier, when we come across a good deal. And we force their dad, when he flies over to see them from time to time, to bring stuff. "
