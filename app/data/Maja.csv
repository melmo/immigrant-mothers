1,baby clothes,to,presenting,family members,pl,female,Some of the baby clothes I was getting from Poland – my mom would bring them over or she would mail them. She and the other grandma bought them there and mailed them to us. ,,"Here there's a store called Primark. It's a store... for the middle class. It's for people who don't earn much, but who can still afford it. I think they have good quality clothes, but not so expensive: when a child wears something down one can just throw it away and buy something new. And one doesn't feel sorry because it cost only a few pounds. But the quality is good. And the clothes are pretty, really pretty. And good quality."
2,baby clothes,from,giving,friend,uk,female,"I passed her baby clothes on to my friends who had baby girls. It so happens that among my friends there are few girls – more boys get born than girls. So when one of my friends had a baby girl – she’s two years younger than Iga – I gave her whatever I had left after Iga. Obviously, parents want to buy some things new. And some things it is just not right to give. Some things you may want to keep, as a memory. ",,
3,baby clothes,from,giving,friends,uk,female,"Now it’s different, now Iga is 4, she destroys things, her pants are torn on the knees. It’s a child who wears clothes down. It’s not a baby anymore. So now I practically throw everything away. Unless they are pretty dresses, in good condition, which Iga had only worn a few times, then, as I say, I pass them on to friends. ",,
4,baby clothes,from,giving,friend,pl,female,"Now I’ll be going to Poland and I have already prepared some of Iga’s dresses which she has grown out of, and some other clothes that are still nice, and I will bring them to my friend. ",,
